          <p>These demo apps add collaborative functionality to several common types of web apps, all dealing with
            completely different types of data and User Interface constructs. To get a sense for the collaborative
            features, get a friend to play around with each app on a different computer. Or open it up in two browser
            windows, ideally on two separate screens.</p>

        <h2>Collaborative <span class="blue">Code Editor</span></h2>
        <p>We connected the <a href="https://ace.c9.io">Ace code editor</a> to the Convergence Javascript client to
          build
          a collaborative online code editor. It is a great demonstration of proper conflict resolution (try editing the
          same code with two users simultaneously). Other collaborative features include presence, chat, remote cursor
          tracking, remote text highlighting. Right-click on a file on the left sidebar to reveal additional
          functionality
          such as file history and playback.

        <p>We enhanced the <a href="http://jointjs.com/">Rappid diagram editor</a> with
          real-time collaborative capabilities via the Convergence platform. See who is currently editing the diagram
          and view their mouse position, selections and viewport. Changes are propagated to all connected users in
          realtime.</p>
