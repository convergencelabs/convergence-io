      <p>Convergence provides high-level APIs for building realtime collaborative applications. Thus, we treat
        <em>your</em> application’s users as first-class citizens. Any collaborative app needs users, and the easiest
        way to add users is through the <a href="https://admin.convergence.io">Convergence Administration Console</a>
        <sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.
      </p>
      <p>Log into your account. On the home page you will see a few cards representing domains<sup><a
        href="#footnote-1">2</a></sup>. Click the ‘Users’ button on the Examples domain card, and then the plus icon at
        right. Fill in a username, display name and simple password, and click “Create”. This will be the “end user”
        that your application will connect as.

    <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 alt-band-title"><h2>Get the Code</h2></div>
    <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 alt-band-content">
      <p>To get the code, clone (or fork) the <a href="https://github.com/convergencelabs/model-getting-started">Getting
        Started Repository</a> from GitHub:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/convergencelabs/model-getting-started.git</code></pre>
      <p>Then, configure the application to connect to <em>your</em> domain using the user you just created. Copy <code>config.example.js</code>
        to <code>config.js</code> and edit the three variables. You should have the username and password of the new
        user, and you can get the connection URL from the Admin console. Just click on the Dashboard link in the sidebar
        of the Examples domain and copy the Connection URL.

        <li id="footnote-1">We often talk about two different types of users: Administration and Domain Users. When you
          signed up for Convergence, we created an Admin User for you, which allows you to sign into the Administration
          Console and manage your account and domains. But when developing, you will be working within a single domain,
          which has its own set of users. These represent users of the application that you will build. In this guide,
          we will create users manually, but they can also be <a
            href="https://docs.convergence.io/guide/authentication/overview.html">created automatically</a> using JWTs.
        </li>
        <li id="footnote-2">Domains are organizational entities: you can think of them as projects, different
          environments (such as Prod or Staging), or some combination of both. Domains are self-encapsulated,
          configurable, and contain their own data and users. <a
            href="https://docs.convergence.io/guide/getting-started.html">See here</a> for more information.
