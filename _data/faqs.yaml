- title: About Convergence
  questions:
    - q: Why Convergence?
      a: We believe that highly collaborative real-time applications are the future. There are vanishingly few good examples out there, and we'd like to push the state of the art forward.  It's still much too hard to build these types of apps, and we believe that you shouldn't have to be an expert in distributed concurrency control algorithms to do so.
    - q: When will Convergence be available?
      a: It's available now!  We offer the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/convergencelabs/convergence-de">Convergence Development Edition</a> for trial use, and have a few customers already in production.

    - q: What's your pricing model?
      a: We offer annual licenses anchored on the average number of monthly collaborative sessions.  Licenses can range from $500 / year to $50k and up for 1M total monthly sessions.  All tiers (outside of <em>basic startup</em>) include dedicated support from Convergence Labs. <a href="/contact-sales/">Click here</a> to get in touch with our sales team and figure out a price that works for everyone.
