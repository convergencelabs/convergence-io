  questions:
    - q: Why Convergence?
      a: We believe that highly collaborative real-time applications are the future. There are vanishingly few good examples out there, and we'd like to push the state of the art forward.  It's still much too hard to build these types of apps, and we believe that you shouldn't have to be an expert in distributed concurrency control algorithms to do so.

    - q: What does Convergence cost?
      a: Convergence is free and licensed under the GPL (server) and LGPL (client). With this license arrangement we aim to accommodate the vast majority of commercial and non-commercial uses while maintaining a strong core product.

    - q: What browsers are supported?
      a: Evergreen browsers (the latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge) are all supported.  Internet Explorer 10+ should also work but have not been heavily tested.

- title: Developing with Convergence
  questions:
    - q: What languages are supported?
      a: We support <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong> along with any other interoperable languages. In the near term we also anticipate a Java / Scala client as well.

    - q: How do I request a feature?
      a: Absolutely! The best option is to create a new post on the <a href="https://forum.convergence.io">Convergence community forum</a>.

    - q: Do you provide a hosted version?
      a: As of early 2019 we no longer offer a cloud-based production instance of Convergence.  We can help you get Convergence set up in your own environment.
