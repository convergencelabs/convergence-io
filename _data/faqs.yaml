- title: About Convergence
  questions:
    - q: Why Convergence?
      a: We believe that highly collaborative real-time applications are the future. There are vanishingly few good examples out there, and we'd like to push the state of the art forward.  It's still much too hard to build these types of apps, and we believe that you shouldn't have to be an expert in distributed concurrency control algorithms to do so.

      a: It's available now!  We offer the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/convergencelabs/convergence-de">Convergence Development Edition</a> for trial use, and have a few customers already in production.
